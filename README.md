# Linear code extraction

This git folder completes the article **Linear Code Extraction: Practice, Countermeasures, Proof-of-Concept on RISC-V**. It provides a simulation framework to simulate the execution of a code on core, and an FPGA-based proof of concept. **Both are independent**.

The chosen core is the CV32E40P, 4-stage in-order 32-bit RISC-V, representative of small ISA RISC-V cores and provided by [OpenHW Group](https://www.openhwgroup.org/).

The unprotected and protected CV32E40P descriptions are available in a [second git folder](https://github.com/theophile-gousselot/cv32e40p_rtl).

# Simulation framework

The **simulation** folder contains the simulation framework implemented to simulate the execution of a code on a the CV32E40P on a protected or unprotected cv32e40p core. Linear Code Extraction can be performed during the execution. Countermeasures can be individually added to the core. This framework is based on the functional verification framework [CORE-V-VERIF](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif) provided by OpenHW group. Codes executed are mainly taken from the free and open source benchmark suite [Embench](https://github.com/embench/embench-iot).



## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone this git folder
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/theophile-gousselot/linear_code_extraction.git
   cd linear_code_extraction
   ```

### Setup Simulation framework

2. Navigate to the `simulation` folder and verify python modules installed.
   ```
   cd simulation
   pip install -r core-v-verif/bin/requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install a [CORE-V RISC-V toolchain](https://www.embecosm.com/resources/tool-chain-downloads/#corev). The recommended installation path is `/opt/corev`. Create a shell variable `RISCV` to the toolchain installation path. Create a shell variable COREV to YES. It is recommanded to add these lines to your `~/.bashrc` file.
   ```sh
   mkdir /opt/corev
   mv corev-openhw-gcc-ubuntu2004-20211104/* /opt/corev/.
   export PATH="/opt/corev/bin:$PATH"
   export RISCV="/opt/corev/"
   export COREV="YES"
   ```

4. Install Verilator by following the [Git Quick Install](https://veripool.org/guide/latest/install.html#git-quick-install). **Be carefull to select the tag v2.220** by running `git checkout v2.220` before running `autoconf`.

The setup is ready ! Simulate, with verilator, a code execution on the cv32e40p core is now possible.


### Simulate code executions

To quickly get familiar with execution simulations, follow the instructions above. They gradually present all the simulation features.

5. Navigate to the `simulation` folder and verify python modules installed.
   ```sh
   cd scripts
   ```

6. Simulate [crc32](#code_name-[--c-%2F---codes-]) code execution on unprotected core without performing LCE.
   ```sh
   ./simulate.sh -c crc32 -r INIT -a 0
   ```

7. The `../log/lce.log` was updated by adding analysis of simulation output. Details about [log files formatting](#log-files) are available.
   ```sh
   less ../log/lce.log
   ```

8. Simulate crc32 code execution on unprotected core with performing LCE with [strategy I](#linear-code-execution-attack-strategies-[--a-%2F---attacks-]). The `../log/lce.log` file was updated and shows that 100% of the code in memory was extracted.
   ```sh
   ./simulate.sh -c crc32 -r INIT -a 1
   ```

9. Simulate in verbose mode. The comparison between original and extracted instructions is printed. The localization of the original code is presented [below](#code_name-[--c-%2F---codes-]). Less command should be usefull.
   ```sh
   ./simulate.sh -c crc32 -r INIT -a 1 -v
   ./simulate.sh -c crc32 -r INIT -a 1 -v | less
   ```

10. Simulate with generation of waveform. The generated waveform is available on `../core-v-verif/cv32e40p/sim/core/verilator_tb.vcd`. [GTKWave](https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) is recommended to open waveform.
   ```sh
   ./simulate.sh -c crc32 -r INIT -a 1 -w
   sudo apt install gtkwave
   gtkwave ../core-v-verif/cv32e40p/sim/core/verilator_tb.vcd ../core-v-verif/cv32e40p/sim/core/signals.gtkw
   ```

11. Simulate execution on protected core with SMM (WWDL=15) while LCE with [strategy I](#linear-code-execution-attack-strategies-[-a-%2F---attacks]) is performing. The `../log/lce.log` shows that the detection latency was 15 executed instructions.
   ```sh
   ./simulate.sh -c crc32 -r SMM -l 15 -a 1 -v
   ```

12. Run a campaign of simulations of execution of crc32 and nettle-aes codes. Unprotected core and protected by the three countermeasures cores (with WWDL equal to 15, 30 then 60) will execute codes. LCE will be no performing, and performing with its three strategies.
   ```sh
   ./run_campaign.sh -c "crc32 nettle-aes" -r "INIT LAM SMM DIM" -l "15 30 60" -a "0 1 2 3"
   ```

13. Run a campaign of simulation to plot the clock cycle overhead. The analyzed outputs are written into a new `../log/lce_overhead-<X>.log` file.
   ```sh
   ./run_campaign.sh -c "mont64 md5sum" -r "INIT SMM DIM" -l "10 15 20 25 30 60" -a 0 -o
   ```

14. Plotting the last already computed overhead campaign. Display the help to discover option -i and -l, useful to plot a specific already computed overhead campaigns.
   ```sh
   python3 clock_cycle_overhead.py all
   python3 clock_cycle_overhead.py all -h
   ```

15. Graph bars of already computed overhead campaign by ourselves, containing 24 codes. This campaign was getting by executing `./run_campaign.sh -r "INIT SMM DIM" -a 0 -o`.
   ```sh
    python3 clock_cycle_overhead.py all -l ../log/already_computed/lce_overhead__INIT-SMM-DIM__wwdl_6-150.log -b SMM
    python3 clock_cycle_overhead.py all -l ../log/already_computed/lce_overhead__INIT-SMM-DIM__wwdl_6-150.log -b DIM
   ```

16. Graph curves of already computed overhead campaign by ourselves for large number of WWDL.
   ```sh 
   python3 clock_cycle_overhead.py all -l ../log/already_computed/lce_overhead__INIT-SMM-DIM__wwdl_6-150.log
   ```

16. As the graph contains too many curves to be readable, plot the average of codes for both countermeasures. 
   ```sh
   python3 clock_cycle_overhead.py all -l ../log/already_computed/lce_overhead__INIT-SMM-DIM__wwdl_6-150.log -a
   ```

17. Finally, explore the already computed log file `../log/already_computed/lce__INIT-LAM-SMM-DIM__a_0-1-2-3__wwdl_10-100.log` getting by executing `./run_campaign.sh -r "INIT LAM SMM DIM" -a "0 1 2 3" -l "10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100`

18. To remove all log generated and to clean core-v-verif use:
   ```sh
   ./clean_everything.sh 
   ```


## Simulation framework operating

 
### Scripts folder organization

The `simulation/scripts` folder is organized as follows:
```
.
├── simulate.sh                 // simulate one execution
├── run_campaigns.sh            // simulate a campaign of executions
├── clean_everything.sh         // clean simulation/log folder and core-v-verif framework
├── lce_analysis.py             // analysis of one simulation outputs
├── clock_cycle_overhead.py     // plot clock cycle overheads of a campaign
├── lce_strategies.txt          // list of linear execution strategies for LCE
└── README.md
```

The `simulate.sh` script runs a simulation of the code execution according to the given parameters.

The `lce_analysis.py` script is automatically call by `simulate.sh` at the end of the simulation of execution to analyze its outputs. Analysis is available in `simulation/log` folder.

The `run_campaigns.sh` script calls several times `simulate.sh` with various parameters.

By vary the Worst Wanted Detection Latency with `run_campaigns.sh --overhead` the graph of the clock cycle overheads can be plotted by `clock_cycle_overhead.py`.

The `clean_everything.sh` script remove `simulation/log/` folder content and clean the core-v-verif framework.

Don't hesitate to use the `--help` option on the scripts.

</p>


### Log files

For every simulation a line is added at the bottom of `simulations/log/lce.log` file, as illustrated bellow. Main [simulation parameters](#simulation-parameters) and [simulation outputs](#simulation-outputs) are given in columns.
 As `run_campaigns.sh` runs several simulations, several lines will be added.

Executing `run_campaigns.sh` with option `-o/--overhead` will create and generate outputs in a new file `simulations/log/lce_overhead-<X>.log` with a new index X.


``` bash

```

### Simulation outputs

The interesting simulation outputs available in [log file](#log-files) are:

- **Extracted:** The percentage of correct extracted code is computed by comparing the original and the extracted codes.
- **Alarm:** The number of cycle which alarm was triggered. If there is no number, the alarm was not trigger.

- **Last_cycle:** The number of the last cycle. As the simulation is stopped when the alarm is triggered, the number is equal to number in alarm when it was triggered.

- **Last_addr:** The address of the PC at the last cycle.


### Simulation parameters

The main simulation parameters for `simulate.sh` and `run_campaigns.sh` scripts are detailed. 

- **RTL [ -r / --rtl ]:** Select which [core version(s)](https://github.com/theophile-gousselot/cv32e40p_rtl) will be used for simulation.

- **Linear code execution attack strategies [ -a / --attacks ]:**
